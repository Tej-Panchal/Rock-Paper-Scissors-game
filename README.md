Project Highlights:

Interactive Gameplay: Play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer with a simple and intuitive interface.
Animated Choices: Enjoy a spinning animation effect for the choices, making the game more engaging and fun.
Detailed Results: After each game, the program provides a summary of your total games played, wins, losses, and ties.
Continuous Play: Keep playing until you decide to stop, with the option to restart the game easily.
Key Features:

Randomized Computer Choices: The computer's choices are generated using a random number algorithm, ensuring unpredictability.
User-Friendly Input: The game prompts for your choice and handles invalid inputs gracefully.
Real-time Feedback: Instant feedback on the result of each round, whether you win, lose, or tie.
This project was a great opportunity to refine my Java skills, especially in handling user inputs, creating loops, and implementing simple animations in a console application. I'm thrilled with how it turned out and look forward to exploring more advanced projects in the future.
